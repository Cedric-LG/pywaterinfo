```
A `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file was generated inside your project but in order to make sure the hooks will run, please don't forget to install the `pre-commit` package:

  cd pywaterinfo
  # it is a good idea to create and activate a virtualenv here
  pip install pre-commit
  pre-commit install
  # another good idea is update the hooks to the latest version
  # pre-commit autoupdate

You might also consider including similar instructions in your docs, to remind the contributors to do the same.
